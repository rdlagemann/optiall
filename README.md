# optiall

Script to automate optimization of *jpg* and *png* using jpegoptim and optipng
  
Generates HTML to visualize images on the browser and check if they are not messy.

I use it for my personal web development workflow.

It's working, but need improvements.

You must have jpegoptim and optipng installed to use it.
